# Ted Herrera — Customer Success Blueprint

I design Customer Success operating systems that turn retention into a predictable revenue outcome.
My work sits at the intersection of segmentation, CSOps intelligence, and lifecycle strategy. I build systems that surface risk early, clarify where teams should act, and align Customer Success, Sales, and Product around a single view of revenue health. Retention is not a reaction. It is a system. When built correctly, it scales outcomes without sacrificing accountability or visibility.
At Best Version Media, I transformed Customer Success from a reactive support function into a predictive growth engine. I architected health scoring models, risk segmentation, and weekly execution rhythms that now govern retention and upsell strategy across a portfolio of 2,500 active advertisers spanning six U.S. regions. These systems directly inform renewal prioritization, publisher coaching, and cross functional revenue planning.
My background spans SaaS, digital media, and MarTech. Across every environment, the objective remains the same: build intelligent, repeatable systems that allow revenue teams to operate with confidence, precision, and foresight.

## 9. Philosophy

Retention is a strategy, not a result.

Customer Success should never operate in the dark. It should surface risk before it becomes churn. It should forecast growth before it happens. And it should align every team around a shared view of where the customer is — and where they are going.

I build systems that make that happen.
