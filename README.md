# Ted Herrera — Customer Success Blueprint

This is not a portfolio. It is a working operating system.
Most CS organizations find out they have a problem when the renewal conversation goes sideways. By then the system has already failed. The account that churns was almost never a surprise to the people closest to it. It was a surprise to the operating model because the operating model was never built to see it coming.
I build the system that sees it coming.
At Best Version Media I took a $36M national portfolio of 3,279 active advertisers across six U.S. regions and replaced reactive save behavior with a predictive operating system. Health scoring tied to real behavior. Risk segmentation that triggers action before urgency sets in. Renewal execution that starts 90 to 120 days out. CSOps architecture that gives leadership actual visibility instead of anecdotal confidence.
The result: 95% gross retention, an 18.9% reduction in year-over-year revenue decline, and a CS function that now runs on infrastructure instead of effort.
My background spans SaaS, digital media, and MarTech. Across every environment the objective is the same: build intelligent, repeatable systems that allow revenue teams to operate with confidence, precision, and foresight.
Everything documented here was built in production and proven in the numbers.

## 2. CSOps System: Retention Intelligence in Motion

At BVM I designed an AI driven CSOps platform that connects customer behavior directly to revenue execution.
Built a weighted health scoring framework across renewal status, product mix, engagement signals, and risk indicators. Developed real time segmentation models for renewable, declined, and upsell ready accounts. Architected Bruno x Hank, an AI powered dashboard providing live visibility into Book of Business, risk ratio, digital mix, and renewal pacing. Enabled weekly retention and coaching cadences by rep and region, replacing intuition with measurable governed action.
Result: 14% reduction in decline rates with improved upsell timing and visibility across all customer tiers.

## 9.Retention is a strategy, not a result.
Customer Success should never operate in the dark. It should surface risk before it becomes churn. It should forecast growth before it happens. And it should align every team around a shared view of where the customer is and where they are going.
I build systems that make that happen.
